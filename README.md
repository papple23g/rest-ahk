REST service for compiling AutoHotkey scripts `.ahk` to `.exe`

Behind the scenes, `wine` and `xvfb` are used to run `Ahk2Exe`, producing a light linux based container, deployable almost anywhere.

## Dependencies
*  nodejs (and npm)
*  wine
*  xvfb
*  Ahk2Exe (Installed to the wine path)

## Examples
The following examples assume either node is running the project or the `rest-ahk` docker container is running locally.

### POST /compile Example
**Note:** The following will produce a Windows executable.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" --output /tmp/test.exe --data '
^j::                    
Send, My First Script
return                  
' localhost:8080/compile
```

### GET /status Example
To status endpoint can be used to view the current service status, including various compile stats.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/status
```

Which should produce a JSON object.
```json
{"compile":{"queue":0,"cache":0}}
```

## Development
For convenience a `.nvmrc` file has been provided at the root of the project directory.
